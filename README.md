# The Computer Maze Assignment
Using code to solve a maze and creating an external tool such as a 3d game engine to help solve a computer maze that is randomly generated.

## NOTE
In advance I apologize for the sate the code of this project is in, the commenting is atrocious and does not represent what my current attitude to coding is especially with comments or how my code is structured. At the time of making this project I was new to C++.

## Introduction
At my university we were given a new assignment and to my surprise it was a randomly generated computer maze. This maze was generated by a given seed which was my Student ID.

This maze would generate a 10x10x5 grid a total of 500 rooms to visit and each direction/corridor being locked behind doors.

Doors can be unlocked by finding keys on the floor and then interacting with them to pick them up, which are then stored within your backpack. Or you can brute force the door and determine its key. Brute forcing is done by using a special option there are many to pick from. My Program had a mode called explore only mode when disabled it would go around the maze brute forcing doors and auto saving their keys for later use. It would log the door position and direction via grid coordinates e.g. "034 = ground floor X:3, Y:4" OR "ROOM 034"

There are events that occur during the maze that you can attend or ignore. Anything from lectures to reading books on certain topics. Reading books such as Philosophy will level you down while reading a book in AI would level you up. So, you will need to decide system to determine if events are worth taking or not.

You have access to the bot’s/student information that roams this maze.
Each move is logged and each action you do takes a move.
You are to take control of the bot’s decision making and determine how it moves and reacts to the environment. 

## The goal
The goal is to get the highest amount of points or score in this maze with the littlest number of moves made possible and levelling up your bot (student) to the highest it can be (Achieved by reading and attending events).

## Extras
Traversing the maze is no easy task as there are teleport zones on the outside the bounds of the maze, they will teleport your bot(student) to a random floor. The highest floor on the maze will not report back any information of your location, you must devise a way of navigating it.

There are also one-way paths where that your bot can get trapped and must find a different exit.

The only way for a bot to move up or down on a floor is on the 4 corners of the maze. These stairs provide limited access and can only let you go up or down on the maze from certain floors.

## Giving this ago
You can download this project and edit the visual studio project file named “Computer Maze Completed.cpp” and editing the function named YourMove()
Most of the code implemented in this was put in at incredible speed due to timeline constraints and had to skip a few things.

## Running my solution

If you want to run my solution you can clone the repo by doing:

`git clone https://github.com/Auzlex/The-Computer-Maze-Assignment/`

Once all the files have downloaded open these files in the following order:

1. Run the "Setup UDP Server And ComputerMaze.bat" this will run the server and then the client visualizer

**Make sure you wait for the visualizer to load first or it will not have time to initialize the maze on the visualizer**

2. Once it has fully loaded you can then begin to run the “runresolver.bat” which will run the exe that I have made to solve the maze.

One last thing the ports **Required** is that ports that need to be open for loopback traffic on your machine is **6532** and **6533**. Used for communication between server resolver, and visualizer
