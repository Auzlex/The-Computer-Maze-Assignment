# The Computer Maze Assignment
Using code to solve a maze and creating an external tool such as a 3d game engine to help solve a computer maze that is randomly generated.

## NOTE
In advance, I was new to C++ when I embarked on this project, so I apologise for the state of the
code and atrociously poor commenting, and it should not be considered representative of my
current capability nor attitude towards coding.

## Introduction
At my university, we were given a new assignment, and to my surprise it was a randomly generated computer maze. This maze was generated by a given seed which happened to be my Student ID.

This maze would generate a 10x10x5 grid, a total of 500 rooms to visit, and each direction/corridor being locked behind doors.

The doors can be unlocked by finding keys on the floor, and then interacting with them to pick them up, which are then stored within your backpack. Or you can brute force the door and determine its key. Brute forcing is done by using a special option there are many to choose from. My Program had a mode called an "explore only mode" when disabled, it would move around the maze brute forcing doors, and auto saving their keys for later use. It would log the door position and direction via grid coordinates e.g. "034 = ground floor X:3, Y:4" OR "ROOM 034". An important note, is that when doing these actions, they will take a move. Another goal of the assignment was to get low amount of moves. In the end you shouldn't go around brute forcing doors during assignment examination.

My bot used a simple method of traversing the maze. I implemented a direction system whereby that all actions the bot does, is directed to where the bot is facing. The bot began simply by moving south until it collides with a wall or door. If it's a wall it will scan all directions for finding a path of least travelled activity. This is possible because the bot logs how many times it has passed over a square. This is used to determine where to go next.  If it hits a door, it will consult the saved keys CSV file, and iterate through them to find a matching key. If "explore mode" is enabled, and it fails to find key, it will ignore the door.

There are events that occur throughout the maze that you can attend to or ignore. Anything from lectures, to reading books on certain topics. Reading literaturem such as Philosophy, will level you down, while reading a book in AI would level you up. So, you will need some sort of decision system to determine if events are worth taking or not.

You have access to the bot’s/student information that roams this maze.
Each move is logged and each action you do, takes a move.
You are to take control of the bot’s decision making and determine how it moves and reacts to the environment. 

## The goal
The goal is to get the highest number of points, or score in this maze with the fewest number of moves made possible and levelling up your bot (student) to the highest it can be (Achieved by reading and attending events).

## Extras
Traversing the maze is no easy task as there are teleport zones on the outside of the maze boundary, they will teleport your bot(student) to a random floor. The highest floor on the maze will not report back any information of your location, you must devise a way of navigating it.

There are also one-way paths whereby your bot can get trapped and must find a different exit.

The only way for a bot to move up or down on a floor is on the 4 corners of the maze. These stairs provide limited access and can only let you go up or down on the maze from certain floors.

## Giving this a go
You can download this project and edit the visual studio project file named “Computer Maze Completed.cpp” and editing the function named YourMove()
Most of the code implemented in this was put in at incredible speed due to timeline constraints and had to skip a few things.

## Running my solution

If you want to run my solution you can clone the repo by doing:

`git clone https://github.com/Auzlex/The-Computer-Maze-Assignment/`

Once all the files have downloaded open these files in the following order:

1. Run the "Setup UDP Server And ComputerMaze.bat" this will run the server and then the client visualizer

**Make sure you wait for the visualizer to load first or it will not have time to initialize the maze on the visualizer**

2. Once it has fully loaded you can then begin to run the “runresolver.bat” which will run the exe that I have made to solve the maze.

One last thing the regarding ports used, is that they need to be open for loopback traffic on your machine is **6532** and **6533**, and used for communication between server resolver, and visualizer
